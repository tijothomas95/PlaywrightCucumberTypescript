Install playwright:
1. npm init playwright
- Validate package.json files
- May delete playwright.config.ts as we are using config.ts to overwrite the default config

Install @cucumber/cucumber:
2. npm install @cucumber/cucumber
- Validate package.json file for the dependency addition

Folder struture:
3. Add features folder with `sample.feature` file
4. Add src folder with steps, page-objects, support

5. `sample.feature` Add feature, Scenario, BDD, Examples
6. Create a dummy step functions

7. Create `common-hooks.ts`, `custom-world.ts` in src/support folder

common-hooks.ts - where we set browser kick off,  PO instances using container.resolve with help of tags

custom-world.ts - where we can extend world interface and add PO class properties.

8. Define export `ICustomWorld` interface inside custom-world.ts where we can add cPO properties

Install ts-node:
npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript

9. Create `config.ts` file with browserOptions and reqtrive it in common-hoos.ts

10. Create `cucumber.mjs` file with default requirements to build the feature-steps relation
npx cucumber-js features/todo1.feature

11. `tsconfig.json` is must as üì¶ Tells the TypeScript compiler how to transpile .ts/.tsx files

12. `npm install tsyringe reflect-metadata` // to add dependency injection and help manage dependencies cleanly across your step definitions

13. Add `@injectable(), @inject('page')` to all class invokes and its constructors.

14. `npm run {script_from_package.json}` // to run the tests as cucumber


Key points to clarify & fix
1. Playwright Test config `playwright.config.ts` (defineConfig) is for Playwright Test runner
This config only works when you run tests with npx playwright test.
It does not affect tests run with npx cucumber-js because Cucumber doesn't use this config.

2. You must overwrite `playwright.config.ts` with a `config.ts` to create configguration for launch browsers explicitly using `common-hooks.ts` inside your Cucumber step definitions
Since you run with Cucumber (npx cucumber-js), your step code must:
Import Playwright (chromium, firefox, webkit)
Launch the browser manually
Navigate to baseURL (you can read from your env config)

üåç What is World in Cucumber?
In Cucumber.js, the World is a shared context object that is created fresh for each scenario. You can attach anything to it ‚Äî like page, browser, test data, etc. ‚Äî and use it across multiple step definitions.


‚úÖ setWorldConstructor(CustomWorld) ‚Äì What It Does
The setWorldConstructor() function in Cucumber.js registers your custom World class so that each scenario gets its own fresh instance of that world.

‚úÖ this.container.resolve?

In a Cucumber + TypeScript context (often using tsyringe for DI), this.container.resolve is used to:
Access shared services or objects
Manage dependencies cleanly across your step definitions
You use this.container.resolve(Class) to inject dependencies in your step files, hooks, or world.
